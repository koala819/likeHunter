## üõ†Ô∏è Discord Bot Configuration
Before running the bot, make sure you have properly configured your application in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications):

1. Go to the **Bot** tab of your application.
2. Enable the following options in the **Privileged Gateway Intents** section:
   - **PRESENCE INTENT**
